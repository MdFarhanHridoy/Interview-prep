Every time you are using a tree or converting Something into a tree
consider using recursion
              1. Divided into a number of subproblems that are smaller instances of the same problem
              2. Each instances of the subproblem is identical in nature
              3. The solutions of each subproblem can be combined to solve problem at hand
